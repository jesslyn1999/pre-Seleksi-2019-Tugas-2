# Data Scrapping in Java 

## Description
Another version of this <a href = "https://github.com/jesslyn1999/Seleksi-2019-Tugas-1.git">repository</a>, though the improvisations are done by using gradle build tools, Lombok plugins and spring framework. The collected data is changed to the data provided by <a href = "https://newsapi.org/">News Api</a> service instead of html parsing.
